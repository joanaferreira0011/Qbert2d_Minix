## The project
*(Please check doc/lcom_report.pdf for a more detailed explanation of the implementation of the project and for some installation instructions)*

Qbert2d is a 2D low level implementation of QBert for the MINIX operating system. It was developed for Computer Labs course of the Integrated Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering at FEUP, University of Porto.
To develop this, we used another version control system, so this repos represents only the final version of the project.
