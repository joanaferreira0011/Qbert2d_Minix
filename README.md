# qbert2d_Minix

## The project
*(Please check doc/lcom_report.pdf for a more detailed explanation of the implementation of the project and for some installation instructions)*

Q*bert2d is a 2D low level implementation of Q*Bert for the MINIX operating system. It was developed for LCOM course of the Integrated Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering at FEUP, University of Porto.
To develop this, we used another version control system, so this repository represents only the final version of the project.

All device communication was handled from scratch, from various devices at the same time, such as the keyboard, mouse or the graphics card.
