# Qbert2d_Minix

## The Project


Qbert2d is a 2D low level implementation of QBert for the MINIX operating system. It was developed for the LCOM (Computer Labs) course of the Integrated Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering at FEUP, University of Porto.
All device communication (such as the keyboard, mouse, timer, RTC and the graphics card) was handled from scratch.

*Please check doc/lcom_report.pdf for a more detailed explanation of the implementation of the project and for some installation instructions.*

*To develop this, we used another version control system, so this repository represents only the final version of the project.*
